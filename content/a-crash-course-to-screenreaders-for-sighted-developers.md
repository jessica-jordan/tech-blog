some intro stuff that's interesting to keep them users reading

## What Is a Screen Reader Exactly?

A screen reader is a form of assistive technology that can be used by blind, visually impaired computer and smartphone users as well as those who have a learning disability or who are illiterate. Screen readers can at times be essential for users to be able to navigate the web and to discover relevant content on websites which is consumed to a large part visually by sighted users.

Even though there are different modi of screen readers available and used by the internet community, the most popular types of device is the text-to-speech screen reader.

## The Problem with Being Sighted and Not Knowing How a Screen Reader Works

With a near perfect (either corrected or not) vision, you might never feel the need to use a screen reader when browsing the internet. So obviously, there's no need for you to understand how screen readers work or how to use one, is there?

As a person who develops sites and applications on the web, it might already be second nature to you to make sure that the websites that you're building work as expected for your users. Checking that a web app runs fine for different user flows or that its design looks as expected is crucial and part of your daily routine at work when delivering a feature. Imagine how difficult it would be to deliver a bug fix for a misaligned navigation bar on a site without having a single glance at your screen. The visual check feels crucial to confirm that your fix for this styling issue is functional.

Is there any valid reason why a functional check would not be needed when fixing accessibility issues for the websites you're building? To be able to manually test websites for accessible concerns, getting familiar with the basics of screen readers is essential to understand how users of assisstive technology experience the site.

## Where to Find a Screen Reader

Today there are plenty of text-to-speech screen readers available, which differ in the way they evaluate web pages. If you want to learn more about how a screen reader works under the hood and which implications this has on different behaviours of screen readers, you should read [this excellent blog post](https://marcozehe.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/why-accessibility-apis-matter/) by accessibility platform engineer [Marco Zehe](https://twitter.com/MarcoInEnglish).
